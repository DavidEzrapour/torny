# Torny - Fencing Tournament Manager

*Torny was made in 24 hours at the [2016 HackRU](https://hackru.org/)
hackathon.*

Torny is a web app that manages fencing tournaments. Torny allows people to
create, register and view results of tournaments. Once you create a
tournament, you can input result data and Torny will automatically
organize the tournament, calculate winners and make the tournament public.

# How was Torny built?

With blood, sweat and tears. Also, Docker, Django, Bootstrap and python.
